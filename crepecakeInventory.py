# A class works with the chain stores that sell crepe cakes in the DMV area
# contains 5 attributes: flavor, price, availableStore, size, and avePricePerSqInch
# contains 6 methods (including the constructor):
# __init__, addStore, getFlavor, getPrice, getSize, getAveragePricePerSqInch

# through the specified number of times (based on
# numCake), at each iteration asking for a cake flavor,
# using that flavor to create a cake object,then asking
# for the number of stores serving this cake (numRegions),
# then calling the summarizeAllRegions function
# (passing the cake object and numRegions as argument),
# and then calling the calculateAvePrice function
# (passing the cake object as argument). It will collect the
# return values from summarizeAllRegions and calculateAvePrice
# and output the list of stores and the price per square inch.
